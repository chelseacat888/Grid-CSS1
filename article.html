        <p>I cant stop thinking about him. I've moved on from my ex ever since he did meth. M is all
            I ever had since I left my ex. He supports me in my budding career as web designer. All
            I can think about is supporting myself so I can be a suitable partner for him. I do want 
            to see him one day but he lives all the way in Odessa. We text everyday. It is nice to have a 
            friend.

            One thing I always wanted to do was be an illustrator. I think that was the first reason why I 
            wanted to be a web designer so I could make money to pursue that hobby. There is an illustration school I want to go to 
            in San Diego and I want enough money to afford it and afford to live in San diego. I also want to 
            do a job where I can be creative. The fun part about being a web designer is that you can work with
            color and typography. I wanted to be a graphic designer but it was too competitive and the wages were 
            too low. I needed something that paid a lot so I could live in San Diego. Luckily, I found illustration
            classes online that are affordable where I don't have to move to San Diego. There is a particular art style I want to learn and it 
            is hard to find art classes that teach that art style. I found Workshops by Danielle Donaldson that is very 
            affordable and that I can save up for. I want to learn watercolor but I also want to learn how to draw animals. I'll keep research on artist
            and even do research on artist that teach at the school in San Diego. I'll hone my art skills and eventually become an illustrator.
